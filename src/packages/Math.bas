' This module enhances VBA by adding essential mathematical functions that
' should be included by default, especially for applications in game development
' and other complex computational tasks. It provides key operations such as
' vector mathematics, distance and angle calculations, and 2D point rotations.
' Designed with performance in mind, this module ensures that calculations are
' fast and efficient, making it an indispensable tool for anyone working with
' advanced geometry manipulations. The Bedrock Team is dedicated to enhancing
' the capabilities of VBA by bridging gaps in its mathematical functionality,
' offering a more powerful and versatile toolkit for developers.
